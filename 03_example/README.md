Examples
--------

This folder contains a couple examples for using `go-allegro`. Assuming everything is installed correctly, you should be able to `go run` any of these files.

1. `hello.go`: a very simple introduction. Creates a window and waits for the user to close it.
2. `game.go`: a slightly more complicated example that creates and runs a very basic tile-based game engine.
